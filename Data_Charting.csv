The disease surveillance has been intensified since 2004. In addition to these localized data, we used locality information from human MPX cases reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and WHO in the 1970s and 1980s as part of the smallpox eradication program; potential reservoir species were identified from previous studies showing MPXV infections in these species, or studies suggesting these species might be important in transmitting MPXV to humans maps of forest clearing since 2000; maps of Sankuru's climate over the past ten years; maps of temperature and canopy moisture",,Yes,NA,,,,,,

For this study, a human monkeypox case was defined as a published report or a non-redundant, unpublished case (with supporting laboratory evidence) recorded in CDC or WHO monkeypox data collections. Cases recorded by WHO during the years 1970â€“1986 were classified based on results of findings from electron microscopy, virus culture, and/or serology. CDC's current case definition requires laboratory evidence of monkeypox virus in clinical specimens demonstrated via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), electron microscopy, or tissue culture; Environmental data sets input into Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) for ENM came from three principal sources. Climatic data averaged over the period 1961â€“1990, including data layers (â€˜coveragesâ€™) summarizing mean annual temperature, mean maximum monthly temperature, mean minimum monthly temperature, diurnal temperature range, mean annual precipitation, wet days, and ground frost days, were drawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; native resolution âˆ¼50Ã—âˆ¼50 km; http://ipcc-ddc.cru.uea.ac.uk/). Land-surface data summarizing elevation, aspect, water flow accumulation, water flow direction, and compound topographic index (a measure of the tendency of water to pool) were obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey's Hydro-1K data set (native resolution 1Ã—1 km; http://edc.usgs.gov/products/elevation/gtopo30/hydro/). Finally, summarized land cover across Africa were drawn from the University of Maryland Global Land Cover Facility (http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/index.shtml).
